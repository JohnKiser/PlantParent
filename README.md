# PlantParent
 
Plant parent is a simple app that keeps track of house plants and how often they need to be watered.

This is meant to only be run on either android or UWP (Universal Windows).

Plant Parent uses SQLite to create a database on device where it stores all of this information called "Plants.db"

The future will keep track of days and inform users when they need to water their plants but that is not implemented at this time.
